### Quick start
- Run pip `install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies.
- Run correct.py to deal with the VM images to create shadow-corrected images. 
- Among the corrected images, check the image quality and choose a target mean and a target std according to the summary.txt for the next step to use.
- Run the analyze.py to generate the output image. The number of loops, branch points, and tubes will be printed out. 
- Adjust parameters to obtain optimized results.
